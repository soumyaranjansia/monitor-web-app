## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** (version 14 or later): A JavaScript runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript server-side.
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers.
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Node.js**:
   - For **Windows and macOS**, download the installer from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
   - For **Linux**, you can use a package manager:

     # CentOS/RHEL
     sudo yum install -y nodejs npm
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-monitoring-tool.git
   cd web-monitoring-tool
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Build and Run the Application Using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build

üí° Usage
Monitoring Your Application
Once the application is running, you can monitor your web application by following these steps:

Configure Prometheus:

Open the prometheus.yml file located in the project directory.
Add your application's metrics endpoint under the scrape_configs section:
yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node_app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['host.docker.internal:3000']
Create Dashboards in Grafana:

Log in to Grafana.
Create a new dashboard and add panels.
Select Prometheus as the data source and query metrics to visualize.
Customize panels to display metrics such as request duration, status codes, and error rates.
Track Performance:

Use the metrics available to track the performance of your application over time.
Set alerts for specific thresholds to proactively address performance issues.
Metrics Overview
Your application will expose various metrics, including:

http_request_duration_seconds: Duration of HTTP requests in seconds.
http_request_status_codes: Counter for HTTP request status codes.
http_request_count: Total count of requests made to your application.
Custom metrics based on your application‚Äôs functionality.
Error Handling
In case of issues:

Check the logs of your application for any errors:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs
Review Prometheus targets to ensure metrics are being scraped correctly. Navigate to http://localhost:9090/targets to see the status of your metrics endpoints.
